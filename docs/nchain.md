PUSHTX and Its Building Blocks
The core idea of PUSHTX (originally invented by Y. Chan and D. Kramer at nChain in 2017) is to
generate a signature in-script on a data element on the stack and call OP_CHECKSIG to verify
the signature. If it passes, it implies that the message constructed by OP_CHECKSIG is identical
to the data element pushed to the stack. Therefore, it achieves the effect of pushing the
current spending transaction to the stack. Since its adoption by sCrypt, STAS token and
Sensible Contracts, the PUSHTX idea has been widely discussed and tested in practice. The
purpose of this document is to offer some security insight and optimisations while revisiting
PUSHTX with an example of a perpetually enforcing locking script. We focus on two most
important building blocks of PUSHTX, the signature generation and the message construction.
The size of its spending transaction is intended to be a benchmark for reference. Other
techniques of pushing transactions to the stack are out of scope of this white paper.
A perpetually enforcing locking script (PELS) is a locking script that enforces some condition or
conditions on all future transactions in the spending chain that originates from the output that
contains this locking script. One example to achieve this is to design a locking script that forces
the locking script in the spending transaction to be the same as itself. Note that a locking script
with an enforcement only on the next spending transaction would have a much simpler design.
PELS are particularly useful for the sender (originator) as they can be ensured that all future
spending transactions will follow the rules which they set out in the locking script. Any violation
of the rules would invalidate the transaction in terms of script execution.
1.1 Generating the signature in-script
The first building block is to generate the signature for a given message 𝑚. We assume that the
following script segment is part of a locking script, and the input data can be either in an
unlocking script or hard coded in the same locking script.
[sign]:= OP_HASH256 𝑘 −1 OP_MUL 𝑘 −1 𝑟𝑎 OP_ADD 𝑛 OP_MOD 𝑟 [toDER]
SIGHASH_FLAG OP_CAT
Input data: 𝑚
Remarks
1. The equation for computing 𝑠 in the ECDSA signature is 𝑘 −1 (𝑧 + 𝑟𝑎) 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛, where 𝑧 is
the double SHA256 of the message 𝑚 to be signed. We write the equation in script as
(𝑘 −1 𝑧 + 𝑘 −1 𝑟𝑎) 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛 to indicate that 𝑘 −1 and 𝑘 −1 𝑟𝑎 can be precomputed. It would be
very costly to compute modular inverse 𝑘 −1 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛 in script. As we are not using the
signature for authenticity, the private key 𝑎 and the ephemeral key 𝑘 can be chosen at
wish and shown publicly.
2. The script segment [sign] as part of the locking script needs to fix both the
ephemeral key 𝑘 and the private key 𝑎. Although anyone can generate a valid signature
using [sign], the focus is on the input 𝑚. The requirement is that there is only one
value of 𝑚 that can pass OP_CHECKSIG for any given spending transaction. If the
private key or the public key is not fixed, then the transaction will be malleable. The
detail can be found in Section 2. If the ephemeral key 𝑘 is not fixed, then anyone can
WP1605

use a different 𝑘 to create a valid transaction with a different transaction ID, which is
not desirable in some use cases.
3. To further optimise the script segment, one can choose small values for 𝑘 and 𝑎 such
as 1, and they can be the same every time. Note that if 𝑘 = 𝑎 = 1, then 𝑠 = 𝑧 +
𝐺𝑥 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛, where 𝐺𝑥 is the 𝑥-coordinate of the generator point 𝐺. The compressed
public key will be 𝐺𝑥 too. The definition of [sign] can be re-written as
[sign]:= OP_HASH256 𝐺𝑥 OP_ADD 𝑛 OP_MOD 𝐺𝑥 [toDER]
SIGHASH_FLAG OP_CAT
4. The script segment [toDER] is to convert the pair (𝑟, 𝑠) to the canonical DER format.
This is the only format accepted by OP_CHECKSIG. It forces 𝑠 to be in the range
between 0 and 𝑛/2 to avoid transaction ID malleability. Although this is a policy rule in
the Bitcoin network, it seems that Bitcoin nodes are unlikely to accept alternatives.
5. Note that SIGHASH_FLAG in [sign] is compulsory as OP_CHECKSIG expects it. It can
be used to specify which part of the spending transaction should be pushed to the
stack. For example, the flag ALL would require all the inputs and outputs to be
included in the message 𝑚, while SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY would require the input
corresponding to this locking script and its paired output to be included in 𝑚.
6. If we extend the script segment to “OP_DUP [sign] < 𝑃𝐾 >” with input 𝑚, the stack
from bottom to top will look like [𝑚, 𝑆𝑖𝑔, 𝑃𝐾] after its execution. A call to
OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY will consume the signature and the public key, leaving 𝑚 on the
top of the stack. If the verification is successful, then one can be convinced that the
message 𝑚 left on the stack is an accurate representation of the spending transaction.
1.2 Constructing the message in-script
The signed message in its serialised format is different from the serialised transaction. The
latter gives away all the information about the transaction, while the signed message
unintentionally conceals some information about the transaction in hash values and offers
some information about the output being spent, i.e., its value and its locking script.
The message 𝑚 cannot be fully embedded in the locking script as it contains the locking script
itself and some unknown information on the future spending transaction. Only some of the
fields can be explicitly enforced in the locking script, e.g., version, sequence number, or
locktime. The message 𝑚 is either provided in the unlocking script in its entirety or constructed
in script with some inputs from the unlocking script and instructions from the locking script. We
will focus on the latter as it is more restrictive from the perspective of a spending transaction.
Note that the goal of constructing the message is to enforce desired values for some data fields
in the spending transaction. The table below captures all the data fields in the message and
whether they should or can be fixed in the locking script. “Optional” is given if it is use-case
specific.

10Locktime 4 bytes in little endianOptional
11Sighash flag 4 bytes in little endianRecommend being fixed for more
restrictiveness
From now on, the data fields in the table will be referred as item 1, 2, 3, etc.
When it is optional, whether to provide the data in the locking or unlocking script depends on
use cases. A general rule is that if the data is available or known at the time of creating the
locking script, then they can be included in the locking script. Another aspect to consider is the
size of the transaction and its spending transaction. By shifting the data between the locking
and unlocking script, one can shift some of the transaction fee cost between the senders of the
two transactions.
Note that when we say infeasible due to circular references, the granularity is set at date fields.
For example, partial locking script or even a small part of a transaction ID (e.g., fixing the first
two bytes of a 32-byte transaction ID and allow iterations through some fields in a serialised
transaction) can be fixed in the locking script if required.
As mentioned earlier, although the focus is to construct the message 𝑚, the goal is to use 𝑚 to
enforce values on different fields in the spending transaction. To enforce the data behind the
hash values, i.e., item 9, the locking script should be designed to request the pre-image, hash

them in-script, and then construct the message to be signed in-script. Taking item 9 as an
example, to enforce the outputs in the current transaction, we can have
[outputsRequest]:= OP_DUP OP_HASH256 OP_ROT OP_SWAP OP_CAT <item 10 and
11> OP_CAT
Input data: <item 1 to 8> <serialised outputs in current transaction>
Remarks
1. The script segment [outputsRequest] takes item 1 to 8 and the serialised outputs
on the stack to construct item 9, and concatenate with item 10 and 11 to obtain the
message 𝑚 in-script. By calling [sign] <𝐺𝑥 > OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY after
[outputsRequest] and passing the verification, one can be convinced that the
serialised outputs left on the top of the stack is a true representation of the outputs in
the current transaction.
2. It is also very useful to leave a copy of <item 1 to 7> on the stack for comparison.
This can be achieved by modifying the script segment as below.
[outputsRequest]:= OP_2DUP OP_HASH256 OP_SWAP <item 8> OP_CAT
OP_SWAP OP_CAT <item 10 and 11> OP_CAT
Input data: <item 1 to 7> <serialised outputs in current
transaction>
After executing the modified [outputsRequest] on the input data, we can call
[sign] <𝐺𝑥 > OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY to consume the message. The stack will have the
current serialised outputs on the top followed by <item 1 to 7>. We will use the
modified script segment later to enforce the output in a spending transaction.
3. It is simpler if consecutive items are grouped together as in <item 1 to 7>. They are
either all in an unlocking script or all fixed in a locking script. However, a more granular
approach is available at a potential cost of having a more complex script.
Note that the serialisation format for current outputs is
a. value of the output 8 bytes (little endian),
b. length of the locking script,
c. the locking script, and
d. concatenate serialised outputs in order if there is more than one output.
The serialisation format for previous output (item 5 to 7) in a signed message is
a. length of the locking script,
b. the locking script, and
c. value of the output 8 bytes (little endian).
In the following example, we will compare the previous output with the output in the current
spending transaction and force them to be identical. The two formats will be useful for
designing the locking script for the comparison.

1.3 Example of a PELS
Suppose that Alice is a root Certificate Authority (CA) and Bob is a subordinate CA. Alice is going
to delegate some work to Bob which would require Bob to publish transactions on-chain as
attestations to certificates. Alice does not want Bob to spend the output on anything else.
Therefore, Alice is going to force all the subsequent spending transactions to have a fixed
[P2PKH Bob] locking script and a fixed output value. Bob can spend the output as he can
generate valid signatures, but he cannot choose any output other than sending the same
amount to himself. For illustration purpose and simplicity, we ignore OP_RETURN payload
throughout the example.
Alice constructs the initial transaction as shown below.

Note that “OP_SWAP <0x68> OP_SPLIT OP_NIP OP_SWAP OP_8 OP_SPLIT OP_SWAP OP_CAT
OP_EQUALVERIFY” is to extract the previous output from the signed message (verified and left
on the top of the stack), then swap the position of the value field and the locking script to form
the expected current output, and finally compare it with the actual current output provided in
the unlocking script and its integrity is implied by the integrity of the signed message.
The length of the locking script is roughly
1
This is to make sure that 𝑠 is in the range between 0 and 𝑛/2. If 𝑠 > 𝑛/2, we let 𝑠 = 𝑛 − 𝑠.

Transaction Fee
Given the current setting, Bob can add his own input to cover the transaction fee. If Alice uses
SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY in the script segment [sign], then Bob can add another
output to collect changes. This effectively makes the enforcement from Alice’s locking script
perpetual. One can think of this as a node-enforced smart contract between Alice and Bob.
It is also possible for the locking script to take the transaction fee into consideration. After step
3, the top element on the stack is the value from the previous output. By adding <𝑇𝑥𝐹𝑒𝑒>
OP_SUB before the concatenation in step 4, Alice allows Bob to pay the transaction fee from the
previous output. This will lead to diminishing value of the output over spends, which can act as
a desired feature as it sets the total number of spends Bob are entitled to.

1.4 Optimisation
As 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎1 contains 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎2 , we can construct 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎2 from 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎1 . In other words, we assume that
the current output is identical to the previous output and use the previous output to construct
the message. If it passes OP_CHECKSIG, then the two outputs must be identical. The script
segment of [outputsRequest] can be re-written as:
[outputsRequest]:= OP_2DUP OP_CAT OP_TOALTSTACK OP_SWAP OP_CAT OP_HASH256
<item 8> OP_SWAP OP_CAT OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_SWAP OP_CAT OP_CAT <item 10
and 11> OP_CAT
Input data: <item 1 to 4> <item 5 and 6> <item 7>
With this new [outputsRequest], we can update the locking script in 𝑇𝑥𝐼𝐷0 and 𝑇𝑥𝐼𝐷1 as:
[outputsRequest][sign] OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <H(PK_B)>
OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
and the unlocking script as:
< 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝐵 > < 𝑃𝐾𝐵 > < 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎1 > < 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎2 > < 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎3 >
where 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎1 is item 1 to 4:

Further improvement can be made by using the alt stack for storing 𝐺𝑥 and 𝑛. Each of them is
𝑛
of size 32 bytes. As 𝐺𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠 is 𝐺𝑥 and 2 can be derived from 𝑛, we can use several opcodes to
reference them from the alt stack. However, it would introduce complications when designing
the script. For example, a comparison of two versions of [sign] is shown below.

We added 15 opcodes and removed two instances of 𝐺𝑥 and two instances of 𝑛. The total saving
is (32 × 2 + 32 × 2) − 15 = 113 bytes. Therefore, the size of the spending transaction 𝑇𝑥𝐼𝐷1 can
be further reduced to 828 bytes.
It is safe to say that with all available optimisations, the size of a spending transaction can be
around 1KB.
Note that any example scripts shown above are not meant to be used in mainnet transactions.
They are written for illustration purpose. Some simplifications are implicitly assumed. For
example, reversing endianness is omitted. For a more practical and comprehensive guide,
please refer to Appendix.

Security Analysis
In this section, we offer some security proofs and analysis around PUSHTX. This is considered a
formal approach to PUSHTX and some of the insights we described in the previous section.
First of all, we notice that there are effectively two signatures in the script execution. One is
created by PUSHTX technique, the other one is provided in the unlocking script for P2PKH. The
first signature provides data integrity and enables enforcement on the spending transaction,
while the second provides authenticity and ensure that only the intended recipient can create
the spending transaction2.
Claim 1:
If (𝑟, 𝑠) is a valid ECDSA signature with respect to a public key 𝑃 on the messages 𝑚,
then it is computationally infeasible to construct 𝑚 ′ such that 𝑚 ′ ≠ 𝑚 and (𝑟, 𝑠) is
still valid on 𝑚 ′ with respect to 𝑃, assuming that the cryptographic hash function
used is pre-image resistant and collision resistant.
Proof:
let 𝑧 = ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ(𝑚) and 𝑧 ′ = ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ(𝑚 ′) for some 𝑚 ′.
Let 𝑢 = 𝑧𝑠 −1 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛 , 𝑢′ = 𝑧 ′ 𝑠 −1 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛, 𝑣 = 𝑟𝑠 −1 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛, and 𝑅 = 𝑘𝐺 where
𝑅𝑥 = 𝑟 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛.
Also let 𝑅′ denote the points such that 𝑅′ ≠ 𝑅 and 𝑅𝑥′ = 𝑟 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛.
Note that3 𝑅′ can either be −𝑅 or one of the two points, (𝑥, ±𝑦),
where 𝑥 = 𝑅𝑥 + 𝑛 if 𝑅𝑥 < 𝑛 and 𝑥 = 𝑅𝑥 − 𝑛 if 𝑅𝑥 > 𝑛.
So, from the signature verification, we have [𝑢𝐺 + 𝑣𝑃]𝑥 = [𝑢′ 𝐺 + 𝑣𝑃]𝑥 = 𝑟 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛.
There are two cases to consider.
Case 1: 𝑢𝐺 + 𝑣𝑃 = 𝑢′ 𝐺 + 𝑣𝑃 = 𝑅
 𝑢 = 𝑢′ 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛
 𝑧 = 𝑧 ′ 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛
 𝑚 = 𝑚 ′ under the assumption that the hash function is collision
resistant.
Case 2: 𝑢𝐺 + 𝑣𝑃 = 𝑅 and 𝑢′ 𝐺 + 𝑣𝑃 = 𝑅′
 𝑢′ 𝐺 = 𝑅′ − 𝑣𝑃
 Given that the message 𝑚, the public 𝑃, and the value 𝑟 are all fixed,
there are maximum three different values that 𝑢′ can take, each of which
corresponds to a value of 𝑅′.
In some use cases where authenticity is not required and it is desired to have anyone
being able to create a spending transaction, the script segment P2PKH can be omitted.
However, any implications and risks should be analysed and assessed before such
approach.

On secp256k1 curve, the group order 𝑛 is less than the curve modulo 𝑝, but they are of
the same bit length. Therefore, an equation 𝑥 = 𝑎 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛 will have maximum two solutions
for 𝑥 ∈ [0, 𝑝 − 1]. The maximum number of solutions can only be achieved when 𝑎 ∈ [0, 𝑝 −
𝑛).

 𝑧 ′ = 𝑢′ 𝑠 also has maximum three values.
 Finding 𝑚 ′ such that ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ(𝑚 ′ ) = 𝑧 ′ where 𝑧 ′ can only be one of the three
fixed values is computationally infeasible assuming that the hash
function is pre-image resistant.
Therefore, we can conclude that it is computationally infeasible to find 𝑚 ′ such that
𝑚 ′ ≠ 𝑚 and (𝑟, 𝑠) is still valid on 𝑚 ′ with respect to 𝑃.
Note that Claim 1 implies that PUSHTX technic is secure to use if we assume that double
SHA256 is preimage resistant and collision resistant. Moreover, it implies that the data integrity
is preserved even when we sacrifice authenticity in ECDSA by making both the private key and
the ephemeral key available to the public.
Claim 2:
Public key 𝑃 must be fixed in the locking script.
Reasoning:
Suppose 𝑃 is not fixed and (𝑟, 𝑠) is a valid signature with respect to 𝑃 on 𝑚.
Let 𝑧 ′ = ℎ𝑎𝑠ℎ(𝑚 ′ ). 𝑢′ = 𝑧 ′ 𝑠 −1 , and 𝑣 = 𝑟𝑠 −1
We want to find 𝑃′ such that 𝑢′ 𝐺 + 𝑣𝑃 ′ = 𝑅
𝑃 ′ = 𝑣 −1 (𝑅 − 𝑢′ 𝐺)
Now (𝑟, 𝑠) is valid with respect to 𝑃 ′ on 𝑚′.
Therefore 𝑃 must be fixed in the locking script.
Claim 3:
𝑘 should be fixed in the locking script.
Reasoning:
Suppose (𝑟, 𝑠) is a valid signature generated in the locking script with respect to 𝑃
on 𝑚.
Suppose 𝑘 is not fixed in the locking script and is provided in the unlocking script.
Then an adversary can:
1.intercept the spending transaction, and
2.replace 𝑘 with 𝑘′ in the unlocking script.
Then (𝑟 ′ , 𝑠 ′ ) generated in the locking script will be a valid signature with respect to
𝑃 on 𝑚.
Transaction will still be valid, but the transaction ID is changed.
Claim 4:
Sighash flag should be fixed in the locking script.
Reasoning:
Suppose (𝑟, 𝑠) is a valid signature generated in the locking script with respect to 𝑃
on 𝑚.
Suppose sighash flag is not fixed in the locking script and is provided in the
unlocking script.

2.Change the sighash flag
3.Update the message 𝑚 accordingly to 𝑚 ′.
In some use case, this would invalidate the transaction. E.g., the locking script
expects multiple inputs and outputs with sighash flag “ALL”; changing the flag to
anything else would invalidate the script execution.
In others, this would change the transaction ID without invalidating the transaction.
E.g., the locking script only enforces conditions on the outputs of its spending
transaction; adding or removing “ANYONECANPAY” would not invalidate the
transaction, but will change the transaction ID.

Appendix
All implementations have been tested on regtest on Bitcoin SV v1.0.8. Please be warned that the
scripts below are for testing purpose only. Any attempt of using them on mainnet should
undergo thorough testing and rigorous reviews.
The result shows that a spending transaction is of size 1415 bytes. The overhead is mainly
coming from reversing endianness. A 32-byte string would require 124 bytes of opcodes to
reverse its endianness. We need to reverse endianness twice in the locking script. The locking
script appears both in the unlocking script and the output in the spending transaction.
Therefore, the total overhead from endianness in our implementation is over 500 bytes. We did
not use Alt Stack to store 𝐺𝑥 and 𝑛 in our current implementation for simplicity. This would save
us about 200 bytes in total.
We present two example locking scripts first and explain what they do. We then present two
transactions with one spending the other using the second locking script, demonstrating that
the locking script works and can be spent as expected.

Input: serialised transaction message for signing as in Section 1.2
The locking script takes the message 𝑚, and
1. double SHA256 on 𝑚 to obtain 𝑧,
2. reverse endianness of 𝑧,
3. add 0x00 to ensure 𝑧 is not interpreted as a negative number,
4. call OP_BIN2NUM to have minimal encoding on 𝑧 (would take care the case when step
3 introduces redundancy),
5. compute 𝑠 = 𝑧 + 𝐺𝑥 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑛,
6. convert 𝑠 to 𝑛 − 𝑠 if 𝑠 > 𝑛/2,
7. obtain length of 𝑠,
8. reverse endianness of 𝑠 (32 bytes),
9. reverse one more byte if the length of 𝑠 is greater than 32,
10. compute the total length of a DER signature (0x24 + 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑠),
11. add DER prefix 0x30,
12. concatenate 𝑟 = 𝐺𝑥 ,

13. concatenate 𝑠,
14. concatenate sighash flag “ALL”,
15. push compressed public key 𝐺𝑥 , and
16. call OP_CHECKSIG.
Note that in step 7 to 9, we have assumed that the length of 𝑠 is either 32 or 33 bytes. However,
𝑠 may be shorter than that. Some care should be taken to pad 𝑠 using OP_NUM2BIN if it is too
short.
